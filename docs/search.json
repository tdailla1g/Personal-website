      "contents": "\nSummer 2021\nDuring the summer of 2021 I’m working with Professor Amanda Luby at Swarthmore college. My team and I are working to better understand and model how fingerprint examiners compare prints as part of a project sponsored by the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. I’m designing a clustering algorithm that incorporates ideas from cultural consensus theory to isolate critical points on a print and allow us to extract information about examiner proficiency all from print annotations without being able to see the prints ourselves.\n2020-21 Academic Year\nI spent the year working with the Movement Advancement Project, the second largest think tank focused on LGBTQ issues in the US. There I did research for the public policy team, which involved both statistical and legal analysis of key policy issues. \nOther Work\nAs part of my academic coursework I’ve completed a number of semester long projects in areas including operations research, linguistics, and psychology. \n\n\n\n",
